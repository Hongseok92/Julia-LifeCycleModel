# Julia-LifeCycleModel
Here I replicate in Julia a simple life cycle model. The Matlab code comes from the course Dynamic Economics in Practice by Costa Dias and O'Dea, taught at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

# Description
This program solves and simulates a finite period consumption and saving (cake-eating problem) problem. There is no income or uncertainty. The consumer starts with an endowmnent of assets and chooses how to allocate consumption over time. Solution is by value function iteration
