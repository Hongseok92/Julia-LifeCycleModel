# Julia-LifeCycleModel
Here I simulate a simple life cycle model in Julia. This is based on Matlab code from the course Dynamic Economics in Practice by Costa Dias and O'Dea.

# Model v1
This program solves and simulates a finite period consumption and saving (cake-eating problem) problem. There is no income or uncertainty. The consumer starts with an endowmnent of assets and chooses how to allocate consumption over time. Solution is by value function iteration

# Model v5
This version adds a realistic income stream with uncertainty. The household gradually accumulates assets to smooth consumption over income fluctuations and during retirement.
